34 You are hereby ordered to repair to 
35 Captain Hogg's Company at Fort Dinwiddie 
36 with eight good men: as that Company is 
37 without a Surgeon, if you will do that duty, an 
38 allowance will be made you for it. You are 
39 to provide medicines, Vc. upon the best terms 
40 you can. This Order I expect will be immedi- 
41 ately complied withsq and that no Delays be of-

52 good mensq which I expect you will see immedi-

55 You are hereby ordered, peremptorily, to be at 
56 this place with what men you have, or can en- 
57 list by the 1st. of December. Your late disobedi- 
58 ence of Orders has greatly displeased me. It is 
59 impossible to carry on affairs as they ought to be, 
60 when you pay so little regard to the Force of a 
61 Military Order - You must be conscious within 
62 yourself (or at least ought to be) that your Crime 
63 is sufficient to Break the best Officer that ever 
64 bore a Commission. 
65 272. Letters, Orders and Instructions. October 
66 28th. To Captain Peter Hogg, of the Virginia 
67 Regiment. 
68 Sir, 
69 I received yours of the 6th. of Octo- 
70 ber, inclosing the Returns of your Company, 
71 only this day. Ferguson was sent after 
72 you, but falling ill, by a Sore on his arm, was 
73 ordered to halt here, where he now remains 
74 unfit for Duty: therefore I have sent 
75 in his room. Sergeant Wilper has received 
76 from Fort Cumberland and this place 
77 Arms and Clothing to complete your Compa- 
78 ny to the Establishment. He has enlisted 
79 three men on his march, and I have or- 
80 dered Ensign Fleming, with eight others, to 
81 join yousq he being a Surgeon, he is desired to 
82 take care of your Companysq for which he 
83 will be allowed. You must use your best 
84 endeavours to secure your provisions, and do 
85 with it as you see most needful :- It is impossi- 
86 ble I can direct about it at this distance, 
87 properly. As we have contracted for a 
88 large quantity of Beef already, you are 
89 desired to engage no more than what will 
90 suffice for your own Company. I shall 
91 see that money is lodged with Mr. Dick 
92 for your use when I see him. You are to 
93 see the usual stoppages from the mens 
94 pay while they are in the Hospital, to 
95 answer the expence of Nurses, Vc. 
96 You must be very careful not to slip

107 Sir, 
108 As those Stockades on Pattersons Creek, 
109 are only intended by way of cover to the Rangers, and 
110 as a Receptacle now and then for Provisionssq you are 
111 desired not to plan any work, which requires much 
112 time to execute. We have neither Men nor Tools, 
113 to carry on the undertaking with vigour.

115 29th. To Lieutenant Colonel Adam Stephen, 
116 of the Virginia Regiment. 
117 You are hereby Ordered, so soon as 
118 the Waggons arrive from Alexandria and Fort 
119 Cumberland, with Clothing and Arms, to see 
120 the men completely furnished with bothsq and 
121 march them immediately to Fort Cumberlandsq 
122 observing to take up all the Salt which the 
123 waggons, provided by the commissary, will carry. 
124 There will come down some of the country wag- 
125 gons, which must also be loaded up with Salt. 
126 As there is some clothing wanting to complete 
127 the Companies at Fort Cumberland, you are 
128 to take up for that purpose forty Coats, thirty - nine 
129 waistcoats, and fifty - six pair of Breechessq thirty - 
130 eight Hats and eighty Shirtssq which you are to have

132 delivered out to the Companies, according 
133 to the Return made me at Fort Cum- 
134 berland, October 26th. - I have sent more 
135 Suits than are necessary, in case of getting 
136 a Recruit Vc. You must do the best you 
137 can in Lodging the men, as the Barracks 
138 in the Fort are full. As Sergeant Wil- 
139 per is waiting the return of the waggons 
140 from the Fort, for necessaries for Captain 
141 Hoggs Companysq so soon as they arrive, 
142 you are to see that he receives such 
143 things as he has orders for, and dispatch 
144 him immediately. If no other Horses, belong- 
145 ing to the Country, can be had here, one 
146 of the Country Teams must be stopped, 
147 and the horses given to him. You must 
148 engage the herdsmen to remain with 
149 the Cattle, until they hear from the Com- 
150 missary or from me. You must engage 
151 all the Coopers you can to make Barrels 
152 for packing the Beefsq and if any of the 
153 Soldiers are Coopers, they must be set im- 
154 mediately to work. You are to receive 
155 from the Stores here thirty pounds of 
156 Goose - which you will deliver to 
157 Captain Ashby's Company as you pass 
158 by, directing him to be particularly care- 
159 ful of it. - If either of the Captains of 
160 the Rangers should apply to you for Ammu- 
161 nition, you are to supply him from the 
162 Fort. A Drummer, with his Drum, is 
163 to be sent from this place with Sergeant 
164 Wilper, in the room of Duncan Ferguson,

166 who is to go up to Fort Cumberland. You are to see 
167 that the men of the Virginia Regiment are exer- 
168 cised as often every day as the duty will admitsq 
169 and that they are practised also in shooting at Tar- 
170 getssq and if there are any who are remarkably 
171 awkward, particular pains must be taken with 
172 them. You must observe on your march good 
173 order and discipline, and see that no irregu- 
174 larities happensq and that the men are not 
175 allowed to pillage the Country, which was very 
176 much complained of in the last Detachment. 
177 You are to apply to Major Lewis for the In-

179 that they are observed.

186 driving the Cattle to Fort Cumberland. You are 
187 to send up Doctor Walker, or go yourself there, to 
188 see them killed and properly salted. Whichever of 
189 you remains here, must purchase such a quantity 
190 of Pork as you imagine will be necessary for the 
191 Troops, upon the most reasonable terms you cansq and 
192 oblige them to deliver it at whatever time you shall 
193 judge most proper. You are to answer, out of the money 
194 in your hands, whatever Draughts Captain Hogg 
195 may draw on you for the subsistance of his Company, 
196 from time to time. You are to see that Coopers are 
197 engaged to make Berrels for the Provisions, and to

277 1st. To Mr. Boyd, Paymaster. 
278 As Colonel Stephen has brought 
279 L1000 which I wrote for to pay off the Troops, 
280 it will save you a journey to Williams- 
281 burg at this time: but I think it absolutely 
282 necessary that you should, after paying the 
283 Troops in Garrison, go into Augusta, to pay 
284 off Captain Hoggs Company, which is now 
285 completesq unless you can send the money

336 5th. To the Honourable Robert Dinwiddie,

338 I have sent the Bearer, Cap- 
339 tain John Mercer (who has accompts to 
340 settle with the Committee to the Treasu- 
341 rer for the balance of that ten thousand 
342 poundssq and to aquaint your Honour, 
343 that meeting with Letters at Fredericks- 
344 burgh, as I returned from Williamsburgh, 
345 informing me that all was peaceable 
346 above, and that nothing was so imme- 
347 diately wanting as Salt. I got what I 
348 could at that place, and hastened on 
349 here to engage moresq - to receive the Recruits 
350 that were expected insq and to wait the ar- 
351 rival of the Vessel with arms, Vc. from James 
352 River, in order to forward them up with 
353 the greater dispatch. The Vessel is not yet 
354 arrived. - 
355 I have impatiently expected 
356 to hear the result of you Honours Letter 
357 to General Shirleysq and with that the de- 
358 Letters Orders and Instructions. December 1755. 
359 lays may not prove ominous. In that case, I 
360 shall not know how to actsq for I can never 
361 submit to the command of Captain Dag- 
362 morthy, since you have honoured me with 
363 the Command of the Virginia Regiment, 
364 Vc. The Country has sustained inconceivable 
365 losses by delaying the Commissaries at Williamsburgh: 
366 many of the Carolina Beeves are dead, through ab- 
367 solute povertysq and the chief part of them too poor 
368 to slaughter. We are at a loss how to act, for want 
369 of the mutiny Billsq and should be obliged to 
370 your Honour to have fifty or an hundred printed, 
371 and sent by the Bearer. There is a clause in 
372 that Bill, which if you are not kind enough 
373 to obviate, will prevent entirely the good inten- 
374 tion of it: i.e. delaying the execution of Sen- 
375 tences, until your Honour shall be made ac- 
376 quainted with the proceedings of the Court. 
377 This, at times when there is the great- 
378 est occasion for Expamples, will be morally im- 
379 possible (I mean while we are on our marchsq 
380 perhaps near the Ohio) when none but strong par- 
381 ties can pass with safety: at all times it must be 
382 attended with great expence, trouble and inconve- 
383 niency. this I represented to Colonel Corbin and 
384 some other Gentlemen of the Council, when I 
385 was downsq who said that that objection to 
386 the Bill would be removed, by your Hon- 
387 ours giving Blank Warrants, to be filled up 
388 as occasion should require. This would effec- 
389 tually remedy all those Evils, and put things 
390 in their proper channel. 
391 We suffer greatly for want of Ket- 
392 302. Letters Orders and Instructions. December 1755. 
393 Kettles: those sent from below being Tin, are of 
394 small duration. We shall also in a little time, 
395 suffer as much for want of Clothingsq none 
396 can be got in these parts: those which Major 
397 Carlyle and Dalton contracted to furnish, 
398 we are disappointed off. Shoes and Stockings 
399 we have, and can get more if wanted, but 
400 nothing else. I should be glad your Honor 
401 would direct what is to be done in these ca- 
402 sessq and that you would be kind enough to 
403 desire the Treasurer to send some part of the 
404 money in gold and silver: were this done, we 
405 might often get necessaries for the Regiment 
406 in Maryland or Pennsylvania, when they 
407 can not be had here. but with our money 
408 it is is impossiblesq our paper not passing there. 
409 The recruiting Service goes on ex- 
410 tremely slow. Yesterday being a day appointed 
411 for Rendezvousing at this place, there came in 
412 ten Officers with twenty men only. If I had 
413 any other than paper money, and you appro- 
414 ved of itsq I would send to Pennsylvania 
415 and the Borders of Carolina: I am confident, 
416 men might be had there. Your Honor 
417 never having given any particular Directi- 
418 ons about the Provisionssq I should be glad to 
419 know, whether you would have more laid in 
420 than what will serve for twelve hundred mensq 
421 that I may give orders accordingly. 
422 As I can not now conceive, that 
423 any great danger can be apprehended at 
424 Fort Cumberland this Wintersq I am sensible, 
425 that my constant attendance there, can not 
426 Letters Orders and Instructions December. 1755. 
427 be so serviceable as riding from place making the 
428 proper Dispositions, and seeing that all our neces- 
429 saries are forwarded up with dispatch. I there- 
430 fore think it advisable to inform your Honour 
431 of it, hoping that it will correspond with your own opinion. 
432 I forgot to mention when I was down, that Mr. Living- 
433 ston, the Fort - Major, was appointed adjutant to our 
434 Regiment: - I knew of none else whose long servitude 
435 in a military way, had qualified better for the office, 
436 he was appointed the 17th. of September. 
437 Captain Mercer's pay, as aid de camp, 
438 seems yet doubtfulsq I should be glad if your Honour 
439 would fix it: so is Captain Stewarts: If Captain Stew- 
440 arts is encreased, I suppose all the Officers belonging 
441 to the Light Horse will expect to have theirs augmen- 
442 ted also. Colonel Stephens, in a late letter, dis- 
443 covered an inclination to go to the Creek and Che- 
444 rokee Indians this Winter. I told him where to ap- 
445 ply, if he had any such thoughts. I believe, on 
446 so useful a Business, he might be spared until 
447 the Spring. If your Honor think proper to or- 
448 der the Act of Assembly for apprehending Deser- 
449 ters, and against harbouring them, to be published 
450 every Sunday in each parish Church, until the 
451 people were made acquainted with the Law, it would 
452 have a very good effect. The Commonalty in gene- 
453 ral, or more through ignorance than design: few 
454 of them are acquainted that such a Law exists: and 
455 there is no other certain way of bringing it to their 
456 knowledge. There are a great many of the men 
457 that did once belong to our Companies, deserted 
458 from the Regiments into which they were draugh- 
459 ted, that would now gladly return if they could 
460 304. Letters Orders and Instructions. December 1755. 
461 be sure of idemnity. If your Honor would 
462 be kind enough to intimate this to General 
463 Shirley, or the Colonels of those Regiments, - it 
464 would be of service to us: without leave we 
465 dare not receive them. Vc.

500 We shall suffer very greatly in a little 
501 time, for want of Clothing for the Soldierssq and none 
502 can be had here, nor in short, I believe in the 
503 Country. Those which Carlyle and Dalton con- 
504 tracted to furnish, we are disappointed insq and 
505 they say, they have searched all the Stores in 
506 Maryland, as well as this part of Virginia, and 
507 none are able to furnish Clothes. We have 
508 sustained inconceivable losses by the commis- 
509 saries delays: many of the Carolina Beeves 
510 are dead, through poverty and bad manage- 
511 mentsq and the chief of them are too poor to 
512 slaughter. Pray make my Compliments 
513 to my Friends belowsq and believe me Vc.
